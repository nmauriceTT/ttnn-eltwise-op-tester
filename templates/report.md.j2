This report contains accuracy analysis plots for various TTNN eltwise operations compared to PyTorch reference implementations.

## Overview

The following sections contain accuracy plots for different types of operations:

1. **Unary Operations** - f(a) = y
2. **Binary Operations** - f(a, b) = y

Note: Tenstorrent hardware does not support subnormals and flushes subnormals values to zero. To reduce clutter, the following graphs do not plot subnoramls outputs.

Tested data types: {{ dtypes }}
Since float32 uses 23 bits of mantissa whereas bfloat16 uses 7 bits, float32 resolution will be `2^(16)` times higher than bfloat16. 
This means that for a given ULP error of 1 with bfloat16, the ULP error for float32 will be `2^(16)`.

## Notes

- All plots show TTNN implementation accuracy compared to PyTorch reference
- ULP (Unit in the Last Place) errors measure precision in terms of floating-point representation
- Relative errors are shown as percentages
- Binary operation heatmaps show ULP errors across different input value combinations

## Data Sources

- Accuracy data: `accuracy_results/results/`
- Plot configurations: `eltwise-accuracy/plot-params.json` and `eltwise-accuracy/binary-plot-params.json`
- Report configuration: `report-params.json`
- Default `memory_config`

## ULP 

- For accurate operations, ULP error should be < 3 on bfloat16 for useful range
- For approximiate operations, ULP error should ideally be < 10 on bfloat16 (but can depend on operation and range)
